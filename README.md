# Linux-UDP-Socket-Project
This repository showcases a simple implementation of UDP client-server communication in C. The project includes a UDP client (`Client.c`) and a UDP server (`Serveur.c`). Common configurations and constants are defined in `Ser_Cl.h`, and a convenient compilation script (`script.sh`) is provided.
